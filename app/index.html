  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Having recently completed an immersive front-end class at <a href="https://www.theironyard.com/">The Iron Yard</a> in Atlanta, I am now a freelance web developer working primarily with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.  The experience of developing a project from the faintest glimmer of an idea to something on a page that serves a function is a tremendous thrill!

  Please take a look at some of my projects.  I enjoy working on individual 'pet' projects such as the family picture album.  Even more, I enjoy the team environment where I can collaborate with others and contribute by solving problems and moving ideas toward something tangible.

    <p>Movie Sidekick was an idea of mine that essentially was to take the "Goodreads" concept to the world of movies.</p>
    <p>The app allows the user to search movies, review movies, connect with other users, and even watch movies on amazon or purchase tickets to current films.</p>
    <p>We used a number of Angular tools, services, controllers and directives on this fairly complex app.</p>
